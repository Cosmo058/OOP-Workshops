1. The reason to specializing the sum() member function is because due the
  template mature of the class, there could be the case that the values intended
  to sum by this function needed to be threated differently. For example, is not
  the same trying to sum strings (adding spaces between each string) that
  traying to sum integers or doubles.

2. The reason for specializing the initial value for the initial_value as well,
   is because initial-safe values are different for each type of varible.
   empty string for std::string types
   0 for int or double types
   nullprt for pointers
   etc.

3. The reason for defining the class variable outside the class definition, is
  because we need to specify a declaration of a template each time we are
  using a template class.
