The main difference between the copy and move operations it is that the move
operations actually take ownership of the resources that are being passed as
arguments to the move operator o move constructor. As presented on line 71 of my
Text.cpp file, the move assignment operator take the ownership of the memory
allocated for the dynamic resources and actually change the value of the pointer
that served as argument to a nullptr. This kind of operations is way more
efficient than make a deep copy.
